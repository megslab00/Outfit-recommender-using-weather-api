# Outfit recommender using weather api
A smart web-based outfit recommendation system that suggests suitable clothing based on real-time weather conditions. This project integrates a pre-trained deep learning model with a weather API to personalize fashion choices according to temperature, humidity, and weather type (e.g., sunny, rainy, cold).  Key Features:  🌦️ Weather-Based Input: Fetches current weather data using OpenWeatherMap API based on user location.  👗 Deep Learning Model: Utilizes MobileNetV2 for outfit classification, trained on the Fashion Product Images dataset.  🧠 Intelligent Recommendation: Maps weather conditions to appropriate outfit categories (e.g., jackets for cold weather, cotton wear for summer).  🖼️ Visual Display: Displays top-matching outfit images along with brief weather summary.  🛠️ Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, OpenWeatherMap API.  Use Case Example: If the weather is rainy and 22°C, the system may suggest a lightweight waterproof jacket, jeans, and closed shoes.
